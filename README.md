This branch is temporary and contains the new library API that will be moved to the trunk.

The intent of this branch is to write a new API compatible with the following compilers:

* `gcc` - from [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org);
* `llvm` - from [CLang Project](https://clang.llvm.org);
* `cl` - from [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs).
